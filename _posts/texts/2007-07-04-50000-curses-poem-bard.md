### 50,000 Curses...

**Cruel John Adair**  
<!--more-->
He brought the sheriff to our doors  
He quenched our fires so bright  
My grandsire is no more  
He died that fatal night  
My mother weeps, her youngest child,  
A boy of beauty rare  
But four months old, so meek and mild,  
Done in by John Adair  

For many a year our weary race  
Have tilled the mountainside  
Have worked old Glenveaghâ€™s rugged face  
Have steamed the Atlantic wide  
Full fifty homes he has levelled all  
And wild sighs fill the air  
Full fifty thousand curses fall  
On cruel John Adair.
