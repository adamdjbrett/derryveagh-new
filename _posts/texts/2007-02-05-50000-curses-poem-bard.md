### 50,000 Curses...

**Cruel John Adair**  
<!--more-->

He brought the sheriff to our doors     \\
He quenched our fires so bright     \\
My grandsire is no more     \\
He died that fatal night     \\
My mother weeps, her youngest child,     \\
A boy of beauty rare     \\
But four months old, so meek and mild,     \\
Done in by John Adair     \\

For many a year our weary race     \\
Have tilled the mountainside     \\
Have worked old Glenveagh’s rugged face     \\
Have steamed the Atlantic wide     \\
Full fifty homes he has levelled all     \\
And wild sighs fill the air     \\
Full fifty thousand curses fall \\  
On cruel John Adair.
