## ARRIVAL OF THE DONEGAL EMIGRANTS --  

The ship Abysinnia which had been anxiously looked for for some weeks past arrived in Sydney on Thurdsay, having left Plymouth on the 24th January. The passage has been rather a tedious one, having met some severe weather shortly after leaving the channel. The Abysinnia has 146 of the unfortunate victims of the Derryveagh tragedy on board who have come out to this colony under the auspices of the Donegal relief committee. They will be on hire in a few days and those anxious for good, honest and willing servants had best apply at once to the agent for Immigration, Hyde Park.
