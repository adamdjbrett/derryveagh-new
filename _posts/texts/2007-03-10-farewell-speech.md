Friends have reached out their hands to you; these friends await you on the shore of that better land...Before you take your foot off your native land, promise me here that you will, above all this, be faithful to your God, and attend to your religous duties, under whatever circumstances you may be placed [sobs and cries of "We will! we will!"]. Never neglect your night and morning prayers, and never omit to approach the Blessed Eucharist, at least at Christmas and Easter. And boys, don't forget poor Old Ireland [intense emotion, and cries of "Never - never god knows"] - don't forget the old people at home boys. Sure they will be counting the days till a letter comes from you. (Translated from the Gaelic)
