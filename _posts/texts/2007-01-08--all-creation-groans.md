### "All creation groans and travails..."

Is the reason Adair first goes to America because Europe, England and Ireland‘s _Great Cattle Plague_ was a Threat to his Way of Life? A clue: that year, this hymn was widely sung in English churches:  <!--more-->

1\. All creation groans and travails  
Thou, O God, shall hear its groan  
For of man and all creation  
Thou alike art Lord alone.  

2\. Pity then Thy guiltless creatures  
Who, not less, man’s sufferings share  
For our sins it is they perish  
Let them profit by our prayer.  

3\. Cast Thine eyes of love and mercy  
On the misery of the land  
Say to the Destroying Angel  
'Tis enough; stay now thine hand.’  

4\. In our homesteads, in our valleys  
Through our pasture lands give peace  
Through the Goshen of Thine Israel  
Bid the grievous murrain<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> cease.  

5\. Hear and grant the supplications  
Like a cloud of incense, sent  
Up towards Thy seat of Mercy  
Through the forty days of Lent  

6 And at last to all Thy servants  
When earth’s troubles shall be o’er  
Give, O Triune God, a portion  
With Thyself for evermore.
